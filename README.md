# Road-Lane-Detection-with-Computer-Vision
This repository contains my work in the field of Road Lane detection. After exploring image segmentation with standard image processing techniques in my M.Eng research project, I wanted to explore image segementation with deep learning. By the way, my M.Eng research project was in the field of automatic cell surgery with image processing. The present work has a corelation to the other repository [Semantic-Segmentation](https://github.com/trived76/Semantic-Segmentation), in this work U-Net architecture is used. 

Lane detection is performed with UNet semantic segmentation architecture. Model is trained on the Berkeley DeepDrive dataset.

For videos, please play it with the VLC player as there is some video compatibility issue with Media player.

Model weights after 15 epochs and real-time model video prediction can be found from this Google Drive Link:
