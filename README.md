# ECE1512-Homework3-LaneDetection
This repository contains my work in the field of Lane Detection.

Lane detection is performed with UNet semantic segmentation architecture. The model is trained on Berkley Dataset. 

For videos, please play it with the VLC player as there is some video compatibility issue with Media player.

Model weights after 15 epochs and real-time model video prediction can be found from this Google Drive Link:
